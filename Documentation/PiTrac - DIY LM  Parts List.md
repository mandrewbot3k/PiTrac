**PiTrac \- DIY LM  Parts Lists**

**Computing Hardware:**

| Quantity | Hardware | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | [Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/) and power supply, 4 GB minimum, 8 FB recommended. | Getting a bundled kit with the Pi and power supply and some other things can be economical if you don’t have any Pi-related stuff yet. |
| 1 | [MAY BE DEPRCATED SOON] Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) and power supply, 4 GB minimum.  It may also make sense for a little more money just to get a second Pi 5\.  PLEASE NOTE - An experimental version of a PiTrac that requires only a single Pi 5 appears to be working and the code has been checked in.  So, if you're building a new PiTrac, you probably don't need a second Pi. |  |
| 1 | [Pimoroni NVMe Base for Raspberry Pi 5 \- PIM699](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5845) ((optional, but recommended for speed and longevity).   [This board](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CQ4D2C9S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) or the 
Geekworm M901 PCIe to M.2 HAT Key-M NVMe SSD PIP PCIe Peripheral Board for Raspberry Pi 5 Support M.2 2230/2242/2260/2280 SSD works well, too.  Whatever you use, try to get one that leaves access for jumpers into the GPIO pins. | For the Pi 5, this allows use of an NVMe memory drive instead of an MicroSD card. |
| 1 | An [NVMe solid state (SSD) memory drive](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BGFRZDTB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (optional, but recommended for speed and longevity) | Typically with an M.2 M key edge connector, in the 2230 and 2242 form factors.  Should probably get at least 256 GB capacity. |
| 2 | Micro SD cards (to bootstrap the Pi’s). | We recommend 64GB size |
| 1 | An Active Cooler fan for the Pi 5 (optional) | The Pi 5 can get pretty hot if you’re doing a lot of big compiles on it.  If so, having a cooler seems like decent insurance. |

**Camera and Lighting Hardware:**

| 2  | [Raspberry Pi Global Shutter Camera – CS Lens Mount](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5702)&nbsp; Alternatively, the following camera also appears to work with PiTrac.  This camera should be much easier to work with than the 'official' Raspberry Pi camera, but we haven't had a chance to test it much.  Consider trying it out!  [innomaker GS Camera Module with IMX296 Mono Sensor ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B093BY2TK2/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?th=1)| The cameras currently used by the LM.  The Pi cameras do not come with lenses (see below), but the Innomakers come with M12 lenses.  The M12 lenses are not tested out with PiTrac yet, but may work if the ball is close.  The Innomakers also come with a short ribbon cable to connect the Pi 5 to the camera, but it's probably only long enough to work with one of the two PiTrac cameras, so you'll want a longer one. |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | [Raspberry Pi 5 FPC Camera Cable \- 22-pin 0.5mm to 15-pin 1mm \- 300mm long](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5819) | The current Pi Cameras have a CSI cable that needs a conversion to fit into the smaller CSI ports on the Pi 5\.  The 200mm should probably work as well. |
|  | [200 mm Flex Cable for Pi 4](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2087) | This likely comes with most Pi Cameras, so may not be necessary |
| 2 | [6mm 3MP Wide Angle Lens for Raspberry Pi HQ Camera \- 3MP](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4563) | Wide angle lens for the Pi GS cameras (which come without a lens) |
| 1 | [1" x 1", Optical Cast Plastic IR Longpass Filter](https://www.edmundoptics.com/p/1quot-x-1quot-optical-cast-plastic-ir-longpass-filter/5421/) (1.5mm nominal thickness) | Blocks visible light below ~700nm from entering the Camera 2 sensor |
|  |  |  |
| 1 | [60 / 120 Degree LED Lens Optical Glass 44mm \+ Reflector Collimator \+ Fixed Bracket for 20W 30W 50W 100W COB High Power Chip (60Degree 100W len kit)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XK7QTV5?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) \Consider getting both a 60 an 120-degree lens for flexibility. | The lens helps focus the infrared IR light. |
| 1 | [High Power LED Chip IR 730nm (you want the 730nm) 850nm 940nm 3W 5W 10W 20W 30W 50W 100W COB Integrated Matrix Light Beads for Night Vision Camera (Select the 730NM, 100W 1Pieces)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DNRT2R4?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1)  | The 730nm IR Led used for strobe light.  NOTE \- this device can get very hot if left constantly on for even a few seconds.  PiTrac just uses it in short pulses. |
| 1 | [Aclorol USB COB LED Strip Lights for TV 5V USB Powered LED Tape Lights Daylight White 6.56FT 320Leds/M 6000K COB Flexible Light Strip TV Led Backlight for Bedroom Under Cabinet Kitchen DIY](https://www.amazon.com/Aclorol-Powered-Daylight-Flexible-Backlight/dp/B0D1FYV3LM/ref=asc_df_B0D1FYV3LM?mcid=70db06b6e26231f3961ef52c9615b991&hvocijid=2003913134214569652-B0D1FYV3LM-&hvexpln=73&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=721245378154&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=2003913134214569652&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9028778&hvtargid=pla-2281435177378&psc=1) | LED strip for lighting the teed-up ball- long enough to double it for more light. 
NOTE - The Strip should produce NO infrared light, or else it will interfere with the IR strobing that the system uses.
|

**Power-Related Parts:**

| 1 | RECOMMENDED NOW:   At this point in time, it's probably safe (and better) to get a higher-power LED driver that can over-voltage the LED.  For example, [a 3000mA 18-39V 120W driver](https://www.aliexpress.com/i/2251832563139779.html?gatewayAdapt=4itemAdapt) | Driver for LED strobe array. Because of the short pulses that are used in the LM, a much smaller (and cheaper) driver may also work, possibly even a non-constant-current driver.   ORIGINAL VERSION:  LED Driver, 12-26V, Output Current DC 3600mA, such as: https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832563139779.html NOTE - Also need a power-plug for some of these drivers that just come with power wires.  For the US, see, e.g., [this](https://www.amazon.com/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTozNDg3Njk4NDA4NzA1MDMwOjE3MzY4NjY2NTk6c3BfZGV0YWlsX3RoZW1hdGljOjMwMDE1OTE3MDMwOTgwMjo6Ojo&url=%2Fdp%2FB0CX1N6QH9%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_2%3Fpsc%3D1%26pd_rd_i%3DB0CX1N6QH9%26pd_rd_w%3DGQ1BX%26content-id%3Damzn1.sym.f2f1cf8f-cab4-44dc-82ba-0ca811fb90cc%26pf_rd_p%3Df2f1cf8f-cab4-44dc-82ba-0ca811fb90cc%26pf_rd_r%3DQR7BKYRYDGSHKFAMD4S7%26pd_rd_wg%3DJjPV7%26pd_rd_r%3Dacea77bd-162b-41bb-9994-5c2cf82355d8%26s%3Dhi%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9kZXRhaWxfdGhlbWF0aWM)  |
